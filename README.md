## Idea

In times of Corona social distancing is key. We want to eliminate unnecessary queues in front of supermarkets & regulate the number of people in stores.

To achieve this, we present QR-Cart. A full fletched reservation & ticketing system that at the same time allows a certain number of non-reservation customers, to fully maximize a store's legally allowed capacity during this time.
